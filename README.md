# Test for kodify interview
## Selenium + BDD + NodeJS
### Why NightwatchJS?
For this test I decided to use [NightwatchJS](http://nightwatchjs.org/) as a framework to run the tests and [nightwatch-cucumber](https://github.com/mucsi96/nightwatch-cucumber) as a module to use BDD to write the tests.

The reason for this choice was the ranking of nightwatchJS on [github](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=webdriver&s=stars&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93) when searching for "webdriver". I tried with [webdriver.io](http://webdriver.io/) and [CodeceptJS](http://codecept.io/) but decided to go with NightwatchJS because of the acceptance and community support.

### How do I run the tests?
